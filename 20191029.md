### UIApplication.shared.open(url)

```swift
    func open(_ url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenExternalURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:], 
        completionHandler completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil)
```

- Summary
Attempts to open the resource at the specified URL asynchronously.
- Discussion
Use this method to open the specified resource. **If the specified URL scheme is handled by another app, iOS launches that app and passes the URL to it**. (Launching the app brings the other app to the foreground.) If no app is capable of handling the specified scheme, the completion handler is called with the *success* parameter set to `false`.
To determine whether an app is installed that is capable of handling the URL, call the [canOpenURL(_:)](apple-reference-documentation://hssXuTJxu1) method before calling this one. Be sure to read the description of that method for an important note about registering the schemes you want to employ.
